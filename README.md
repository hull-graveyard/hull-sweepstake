# About this project

This project is built on the Hull platform, with [Aura](github.com/aurajs/aura), [Backbone.js](https://github.com/documentcloud/backbone) and lots of other cool libraries.

**You don't need an account on Hull to use it locally, the App key is already present in this app.**

The steps below are tailored for Mac environments.  
Linux should mostly work the same.

## How it was done


1. Create a new Hull app using our [Grunt-init task](https://github.com/hull/grunt-init-hull).

        grunt-init instant-win


2. Add a new HTML page called ``admin.html``, and insert a ``instant_win_admin@hull`` widget to write your questions.

        <!-- Instant Win Admin Widget -->
        <div data-hull-widget="instant_win_admin@hull"></div>


3. Copy the newly created Instant Win's ID, and insert a ``instant_win@hull`` widget inside the main HTML page.

        <!-- Quiz Widget -->
        <div data-hull-widget="instant_win@hull" data-hull-id="512383795ef8755c63000001"></div>

4. â€¦ *Customization steps*

5. Do a bit of CSS to have an effective design.

6. **There's no step 6.**


## Installing

First, clone this repository :

    git clone git://github.com/hull/instant-win.git

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org) (Only used for building the app, not needed for deployment)

Install [grunt-cli](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) as a global module.
It's amazing so you should do it anyways.

    [sudo] npm install grunt-cli -g
    [sudo] npm install bower -g

then install grunt and it's modules in the project's folder.

    cd instant-win/
    npm install
    bower install

## Running the app

**To run the app locally, run:**

    grunt server

## Deploying

First create your heroku app if it's not done yet :

    heroku create your_amazing_app

Build your app for deployement, and commit the compiled version:

    grunt build
    cd dist
    git init
    git add dist
    git commit -m "Deployment build"
